👋 **Hi, I'm Corina, a frontend developer with a background in math teaching.**
<br>
<br>I love translating modern designs into accessible and responsive websites.
<br>
<br>These days I am excited to be putting to use my newly acquired REACT skills. 🎉 
<br>⬇️ Please scroll below to look at my latest projects!
<br>
<br>Just completed [TWAIN & COMPANY](https://twain-and-company.netlify.app/), a bookstore website  •  Features a shopping cart 
<br>that displays cart items and total amount when clicked • Used Firebase to store 
<br>books data and cover images  •  Book orders are also submitted to Firebase 
<br>

<br>Please visit [my Frontend Mentor page](https://www.frontendmentor.io/profile/Cor-Ina) to learn more about some of my previous work.
<br>I always **WELCOME** questions about my code or suggestions on how to improve it, <br>especially on features related to accessibility.


<br>🛠 **My tools:**
- JavaScript, React
- CSS, SCSS, BEM
- A11y
- Firebase
- Figma

<br>📚 **Currently learning: NextJS**
<br>
<br>🔍 **Foundational knowledge: C, Python**
<br>
<br>⚙️ **Curious about: C++**


<br>♿️ **A digital product that is not accessible, it is NOT ready.
<br>The hardest part of learning to develop websites has been finding code examples
<br>for accessible web features. So far, these have been my favorite resources:**
  - [Jon Kuperman's Website Accessibility course](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/accessibility-v2/) on Frontend Masters
  - [W3C Before and After Demonstration](https://www.w3.org/WAI/demos/bad/)
  <br>It showcases an inaccessible website and a retrofitted version of the same website. 
  <br>Each page includes inline annotations that can be activated to identify and
  <br>highlight important accessibility barriers or the corresponding repairs made. 
  - [Duke University Accessibility pages](https://web.accessibility.duke.edu/how/web-development/)
  - [Harvard's Accessibility pages](https://accessibility.huit.harvard.edu/content-creators)

                         
<br>👷 **I am open to collaborating on a11y / JavaScript / React projects.**
