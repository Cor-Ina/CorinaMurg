👋 **Hi, I'm Corina, a web developer with a background in math teaching.**
<br>
<br>I am currently on my frontend journey focusing on JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, but I am equally curious about 
<br>the inner workings of an application's backend, and plan on diving back into Python and SQL real soon.
<br>

<br>These days I am excited to be putting to use my REACT + A11y skills. 🎉 
<br>⬇️ Please scroll below to look at my latest projects!
<br>


<br>**Currently:**
<br>**Software Developer at [The Collab Lab](https://the-collab-lab.codes), a collaborative group project practice for entry-level developers**
- Collaborate with other developers on a real-world project under the guidance of experienced mentors
- Mastering version control through GitHub, efficiently handling pull requests, merges, and conflict resolution
- Rigorously implementing WCAG accessibility guidelines

<br>**Developing [Twain & Company](https://twain-and-company.netlify.app/), a bookstore website in React**
- Features a shopping cart that displays cart items and total amount when clicked
- Uses Firebase for backend integration: to store books data, cover images, and  customer ook orders
- Accessibility-first approach

<br>📚 **Studying for the CPACC - Certified Professional in Accessibility Core Competencies - exam**

<br>🛠 **My tools:**
- JavaScript, React
- CSS, BEM
- A11y
- Firebase
- Git
- Figma

<br>🔍 **Foundational knowledge: C, Python, SQL**
<br>
<br>⚙️ **Curious about: C++**

<br>I always **WELCOME** questions about my code or suggestions on how to improve it, <br>especially on features related to accessibility.
<br>

<br>♿️ **A digital product that is not accessible, it is NOT ready.
<br>The hardest part of learning to develop websites has been finding code examples
<br>for accessible web features. So far, these have been my favorite resources:**
  - [Jon Kuperman's Website Accessibility course](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/accessibility-v2/) on Frontend Masters
  - [W3C Before and After Demonstration](https://www.w3.org/WAI/demos/bad/)
  <br>It showcases an inaccessible website and a retrofitted version of the same website. 
  <br>Each page includes inline annotations that can be activated to identify and
  <br>highlight important accessibility barriers or the corresponding repairs made. 
  - [Duke University Accessibility pages](https://web.accessibility.duke.edu/how/web-development/)
  - [Harvard's Accessibility pages](https://accessibility.huit.harvard.edu/content-creators)

                         
<br>👷 **I am open to collaborating on a11y / JavaScript / React projects.**
