👋 **Hi, I'm Corina, a self-taught web developer with a background in math teaching.**
<br>
<br>I’ve embraced and fallen in love with every single programming language I’ve encountered, but decided to take the frontend path and therefore focus on JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. My background is in creating learning experiences that are inclusive and accessible. For that reason, the frontend's concern with creating accessible web products deeply resonates with me.

Curious about some of my projects? I am currently working on a meal planner app using JavaScript and the OpenAI API. 🎉
<br>Don't forget to checkout [Twain & Company](https://twain-and-company.netlify.app/), a bookstore website in React, and [Neat Notes](https://neatnotes.netlify.app/), my favorite note-taking application for desktop. 😉
<br>If you like games, or are curious about how to use JavaScript and ES6 classes and Constructors to build a 2D platform game, have a look at [Lava Leap](https://lava-leap.netlify.app/) for a fun time.


<br>🛠 **My tools:**
<br>
<br>**JavaScript**  •  **NodeJS**  •  **React**  •  **Express**
<br>
<br>**CSS**  •  **BEM**  •  **HTML**  •  **A11y**  •  **Figma**
<br>
<br>**Git**  •  **Firebase**  •  **OpenAI API**  

<br>🔍 **Foundational knowledge: C, Python, SQL**
<br>
<br>⚙️ **Curious about: C++**

<br>I always **WELCOME** questions about my code or suggestions on how to improve it, especially on features related to accessibility.
<br>

                         
<br>👷 **I am open to collaborating on a11y / JavaScript / React projects.**
