I am a self-taught software engineer with a background in math teaching.
<br>
<br>As a teacher my focus was on creating learning experiences that were inclusive and accessible. For that reason, the frontend's concern with accessible web products deeply resonates with me.
<br>
<br>I am excited to collaborate on projects with developers from all over the world, and engage in conversations about our responsibility to ensure that every user feels seen and valued. I believe in a web where everyone has a place!

üéÆ [Lava Leap](https://lava-leap.netlify.app/), a 2D platform game built withJavaScript and ES6 classes and constructors.
<br>üìö [Twain & Company](https://twain-and-company.netlify.app/), a bookstore website in React.
