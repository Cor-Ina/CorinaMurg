A self-taught frontend developer with a background in math teaching and a passion for accessibility.
<br>
<br>‚úîÔ∏è I'm an Accessibility Engineer with a [DHS Trusted Tester certification](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7164319315268124672/). 
<br>
<br>‚úîÔ∏è I created [Web for Everyone](https://webforeveryone.us), an initiative dedicated to teaching junior developers to actively embrace accessibility. The project is a 
beginner-friendly source of
- articles on foundational concepts;
- techniques to avoid common accessibility bugs;
- code examples.

## üîé Current focus:
I'm deep diving into tools like Playwright and DevTools that help developers stay mindful of accessibility.
- Do you know that 96% of home pages have accessibility bugs? But do you also know that you can automate testing for them with Playwright and the axe-core library? True!
