👋 Hi, I'm Corina, a frontend developer with a background in math teaching.
<br>
<br> My current work involves translating modern designs created by [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io)
<br> into accessible, responsive, and pixel-perfect websites.

Please visit [my Frontend Mentor page](https://www.frontendmentor.io/profile/Cor-Ina) to learn more about my work.
<br>I welcome questions or suggestions on how to improve my code, especially on features related to accessibility.

🛠 My tools:
- HTML5 and CSS3
- a11y
- JavaScript
- Figma + Sketch

📚 Currently learning: React

My favorite resources on learning about accessibility:
  - [W3C Before and After Demonstration](https://www.w3.org/WAI/demos/bad/): Showcases an inaccessible website and a retrofitted version of the same website. Each page includes inline annotations that can be activated to identify and highlight important accessibility barriers or the corresponding repairs made. Additionally, an evaluation report accompanies each web page, providing developers with insights into the website's conformance to the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG).
  - [Duke University Accessibility page](https://web.accessibility.duke.edu/how/web-development/)
  - [Jon Kuperman's Website Accessibility course](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/accessibility-v2/) on Frontend Masters
                         
👷 I am open to collaborating on a11y / CSS / JavaScript projects.
