üëã **Hi, I'm Corina, a frontend developer with a background in math teaching.**
<br>
<br>I love translating modern designs into accessible and responsive websites.
<br>
<br>These days I am putting to work my newly acquired React skills to develop a one-of-a-kind 
<br>tourism website. Do you want to visit the most beautiful libraries in the world?
<br>Or maybe the homes of your favorite authors? Why not the places that inspired the world's
<br>most beautiful poems? My website will open the door to your dream cultural adventure!

Please visit **[my Frontend Mentor page](https://www.frontendmentor.io/profile/Cor-Ina)** to learn more about some of my previous work.
<br>I always **WELCOME** questions about my code or suggestions on how to improve it, <br>especially on features related to accessibility.



<br>üõ† **My tools:**
- CSS, SCSS, BEM
- A11y
- JavaScript, React
- Firebase
- Figma

<br>üìö **Currently learning: NextJS**
<br>

<br>üìú **My web development certifications:**
<br>
- Meta: Introduction to Frontend Development‚Äã
- Google: Foundations of User Experience Design
- freeCodeCamp: JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures
- LinkedIn: Accessibility for Web Design


<br>Quick overview of my current React project, [**Tenzies**](https://corina-tenzies.netlify.app/), a number game:
<br>
<br>Image description: Snapshot of a game on Tenzies. The rules read:
<br>"Roll until all dice are the same. Click each die to freeze it at its current
<br> value between rolls." Ten dice are shown in two rows, with values 2, 2, 1, 4,
<br>  2, 2, 1, 5, 1, 1. All values of 1 have a yellow background because they are 
<br>frozen values. Last element is a blue roll button.
<br>
[<img alt="Screenshot of the Tenzies game. " src="./images/Tenzies.jpg" width="300" height="auto">](https://corina-tenzies.netlify.app/)
<br>The game is accessible via keyboard, but it has one major bug: 
<br>after the first roll, the focus does not move to the first unfrozen die.
<br>Check back later, I will get it to work! I am also welcoming any suggestions.
<br>Thank you in advance.



<br>‚ôøÔ∏è **A digital product that is not accessible, it is NOT ready.
<br>The hardest part of learning to develop websites has been finding code examples
<br>for accessible web features. So far, these have been my favorite resources:**
  - [W3C Before and After Demonstration](https://www.w3.org/WAI/demos/bad/)
  <br>It showcases an inaccessible website and a retrofitted version of the same website. 
  <br>Each page includes inline annotations that can be activated to identify and
  <br>highlight important accessibility barriers or the corresponding repairs made. 
  - [Duke University Accessibility pages](https://web.accessibility.duke.edu/how/web-development/)
  - [Harvard's Accessibility pages](https://accessibility.huit.harvard.edu/content-creators)
  - [Jon Kuperman's Website Accessibility course](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/accessibility-v2/) on Frontend Masters
                         
<br>üë∑ **I am open to collaborating on a11y / CSS / JavaScript / React projects.**
