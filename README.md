A self-taught frontend developer with a background in math teaching and a passion for accessibility.
<br>
<br>✔️ I'm an Accessibility Engineer with a [DHS Trusted Tester certification](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7164319315268124672/). 
<br>
<br>✔️ I created [Web for Everyone](https://webforeveryone.us), an initiative dedicated to teaching junior developers to actively embrace accessibility. The project is a 
beginner-friendly source of
- articles on foundational concepts;
- techniques to avoid common accessibility bugs;
- code examples.

## 🔎 Current focus
Deep diving into tools that assist developers in identifying and resolving accessibility issues effectively:
- Accessibility Automation with Playwright: I'm exploring and testing various functions in Playwright to determine which accessibility checks could be automated and integrated into the CI/CD pipeline to prevent accessibility issues from reaching production.
- Chromium Codebase exploration: I'm working to understand the principles behind the construction of the accessibility tree, a crucial tool for debugging for accessibility

## 💡 Did you know?
- 96% of home pages have accessibility bugs. But did you know you can automate testing for these issues using Playwright and the axe-core library? It's true!
- The accessibility tree, available via DevTools in all major browsers, can help detect critical accessibility bugs, such as unfocusable buttons or links without accessible names? Also true!

Please reach out if you’d like to learn more about these tools!
