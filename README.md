👋 **Hi, I'm Corina, a frontend developer with a background in math teaching.**
<br>
<br> My current work involves translating modern designs created by 
<br> [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) into accessible and responsive websites.

Please visit **[my Frontend Mentor page](https://www.frontendmentor.io/profile/Cor-Ina)** to learn more about my work.
<br>I **WELCOME** questions about my code or suggestions on how to improve it, <br>especially on features related to accessibility.



<br>🛠 **My tools:**
- CSS, BEM
- A11y
- JavaScript
- Figma + Sketch

<br>📚 **Currently learning: React, Sass**
<br>
<br>Quick link to my current React project, [**Tenzies**](https://corina-tenzies.netlify.app/), a number game
<br>
<br>Image description: Snapshot of a game on Tenzies. The rules read:
<br>"Roll until all dice are the same. Click each die to freeze it at its current
<br> value between rolls." Ten dice are shown in two rows, with values 2, 2, 1, 4,
<br>  2, 2, 1, 5, 1, 1. All values of 1 have a yellow background because they are 
<br>frozen values. Last element is a blue roll button.
<br>
[<img alt="Screenshot of the Tenzies game. " src="./images/Tenzies.jpg" width="400" height="auto">](https://corina-tenzies.netlify.app/)
<br>The game is accessible via keyboard, but it has one major bug: 
<br>after the first roll, the focus does not move to the first unfrozen die.
<br>Check back later, I will get it to work! I am also welcoming any suggestions.
<br>Thank you in advance.



<br>♿️ **A digital product that is not accessible, it is NOT ready.
<br>The hardest part of learning to develop websites has been finding code examples
<br>for accessible web features. So far, these have been my favorite resources:**
  - [W3C Before and After Demonstration](https://www.w3.org/WAI/demos/bad/)
  <br>It showcases an inaccessible website and a retrofitted version of the same website. 
  <br>Each page includes inline annotations that can be activated to identify and
  <br>highlight important accessibility barriers or the corresponding repairs made. 
  - [Duke University Accessibility pages](https://web.accessibility.duke.edu/how/web-development/)
  - [Harvard's Accessibility pages](https://accessibility.huit.harvard.edu/content-creators)
  - [Jon Kuperman's Website Accessibility course](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/accessibility-v2/) on Frontend Masters
                         
<br>👷 **I am open to collaborating on a11y / CSS / JavaScript / React projects.**
